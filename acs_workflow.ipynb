    "# ACS Occupation Autocoder Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "*The U.S. Census Bureau reviewed this data product for unauthorized disclosure of confidential information and approved the disclosure avoidance practices applied to this release. CBDRB-FY21-POP001-0171.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The American Community Survey (ACS) asks employed respondents to report about their occupation and typical activities on the job in open-ended text fields. Traditionally, clerical coders at the Census National Processing Center manually assign Census occupation codes to write-in entries. In 2012, Census implemented a logistic regression autocoder in an attempt to reduce the number of cases sent to clerical coding. This jupyter notebook presents a complete machine learning (ML) workflow to develop an autocoder to assign Census occupation codes to occupation write-in data from the 2018 and 2019 ACS. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to evaulate the autocoder and find areas where it can be improved. My evaluation strategy was to develop a competing autocoder using updated ML tools to determine if it could result in fewer cases going to clerical coding while maintaining a consistent level of (and ideally improving) prediction accuracy. As you will see below, I leverage existing linkage data with a random forest classifier to implement a custom \"ensemble\" that improves model accuracy over the existing autocoder. For example, at one threshold of model accuracy, the current production autocoder (2012 vintage) saves about 50 percent of records from going to clerical coding, while my ensemble saves about 86 percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use ML methods for the write-in data, I use natural language processing (NLP) technique to convert write-in text into a numeric form. No pre-processing is done to the text; instead, I rely on a pipeline that would conceivably have enough support to detect a signal from the write-ins while allowing for common spelling errors to have weight in generating predictions (with more time, however, exploring alternatives would have been useful). Even with the subsample used here (more on this below) and using lemmatized text to reduce the horizontal dimension of input matrices, model features exceeded 100,000. For the freamework chosen, this sample size (roughly a 3 percent subsample of all data available), easily runs into memory limitations on the existing computing infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ML model used here was estimated in a separate routine, chosen by Grid Search, and then \"pickled\" for use here. Code generating the Grid Search is available by request. However, that code is farily generic. The majority of processing work involves data preparation and feature engineering, which is demonstrated in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow consists of loading write-in data, conducting feature engineering, and applying a custom ML \"ensemble\" consisting of an \"index autocoder\" (see the `exact_match_results.ipynb` notebook in this repository) and a Random Forest Classifier. I then evaluate the model accuracy and record indicators of which records were assigned matches at a given stage. I also present a simple heuristic that will help stakeholders and other decision makers choose a simple accuracy threshold that can determine the expected cost savings associated with different modeling options. For example, I calculate the number of records that must go to clerical coding for a given model accuracy; that tradeoff can be chosen by choosing a predicted probability threshold. If estimates of the per-unit cost (in dollars and/or time) is known *ex ante*, this heuristic could provide a direct cost savings estimate for different modeling options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Census occupation codes for these files are based on the 2018 [Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) System](https://www.bls.gov/soc/)). See my other [repository](https://github.com/krwilkin/census-occ-to-soc) for a more detailed discussion of the relationship between the SOC and Census occupation codes."

These fields include all engineered features as well as the vectorized text features used by the `nltk` algorithms. Because the vectorization was done on the full sample, we must first vectorize the complete file then isolate the set of unmatched records to be processed through the model. Vectorization for this model was done on lemmatized text. I present a user-defind function `cleantext()` that lemmatizes the occupation write-ins (note that we use `ocw3` as the text field). In order to use the built-in TF-IDF vectorizer on lemmatized text, it is necessary to define a \"dummy\" function."

It is well known from the urban economics literature that specialized occupations are more likely to be found in larger urban areas. The MSA is a useful (though imperfect) proxy for a city. MSAs are comprised of one or more counties where one county represents the urban \"core\" with a population of 50,000 or more residents and any other counties are included if they are adjacent to MSA counties and meet certain thresholds of daily commuting to the urban core. I match MSA code based on a crosswalk between state and county FIPS codes in the ACS. MSA population is calculated as the sum of population for each county in the MSA. Population estimates are taken from public-use data published on the Census Web site."

    "### Feature Engineering\n",
    "In this section I develop additional features to add to the model. The chosen set of features are based on a my experience working with individual labor market data and capture relevant characteristics that might predict differences in occupation. In addition, I add features related to the interview, such as interview mode, that might predict the quality of certain write-ins (e.g., spelling). Research also shows that respondents tend to not report earnings at higher rates than other survey content and that earnings \"non-response\" tends to be highest in the tails of the earnings distribution. If some occupations systematically occupy areas of the earnings distribution then earnings levels and the incidence of earnings non-response might be predictive of occupation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other features include binary indicators of education level, age (scaled to be between zero and one), and a binary indicator for female. To deal with large continuous figures, such as MSA population size and earnings, I break each measure into a series of mutually exclusive categorical variables and then define separate binary indicators for each. I use a custom approach for doing so (instead of, say, `OneHotEncoding`), so that I can control the names of the features created, which aids in selecting a parsimonious data set for analysis. MSA population categories are standard as used by the Current Population Survey. I break the earnings distribution (both `UWAG` and `USEM`) into quantiles and then generate dummies for each quantile. Note that I used unedited earnings because many of the features that I use here are likely inputs for Census imputation methods and I prefer to avoid over-using correlated features. Using unedited earnings also allows for identifying a simple \"missing earnings\" indicator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversations with IOSB staff indicated that many write-ins are in Spanish and that these may be disproportionately from respondents in Puerto Rico. To control for this, I use a binary indicator for Peurto Rico. However, MSAs definitions are restricted to the 50 United States and the District of Columbia."

    "The above results show that relying on conventional probability thresholds for occupation predictions ($Pr=0.88$) would be overly strict for this model. The average predicted probability for cases where occupation codes are predicted correctly is $Pr=0.13$ compared to average predicted probability of $Pr=0.03$ for cases that were matched incorrectly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The plot above shows the distribution of predicted probabilities by prediction accuracy. Although predicted probabilities are low for most cases, those predicted correctly occupy the bulk of predicted probabilities in excess of $Pr=0.2$. Thus, these methods may be useful for prediction with a change in threshold predicted probability for accepting on a match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that many cases predicted accurately have predicted probabilities less than 0.2. Another option for selection would be to accept occupation code predictions based on the relationship of the maximum predicted probability to the probability distribution within a write-in. For example, each write-in has a predicted probability that it could belong to any one of the 570 occupation classes modeled here. Instead of choosing a one-size-fits-all threshold, we could instead select code assignments where the predicted probability lies sufficiently far away from the mean of other predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function `probsigma(prob_dist, dev_dist)` returns a 1 or 0 depending on whether the max value of a probability distribution `prob_dist` is greater than `dev_dist` standard deviations from its mean. Exploration of different values indicated that predicted probabilities were more likely to lie within three or *more* standard deviations from the mean of a set of predictions than they are to be greater than some fixed threshold. Below I show the incidence of predictions where the maximum probability of a prediction is within six standard deviations (\"six sigma\") from the mean set of predictions and the set of records for which the maximum predicted probability is greater than or equal to 0.17."

    "The above results demonstrate that we could retain a higher fraction of predictions choosing a flexible probability cutoff within each prediction versus a one-size-fits-all cutoff. About 25 percent of predictions from the random forest model would be retained using a probability cutoff of 0.17 compared to about 92 percent by selecting cases where the maximum probability is greater than six standard deviations from the mean. Of course, based on the graphic above, it is possible that those with predicted probabilities greater than 0.17 would almost universally be \"accurate\" predictions. Next, we compare the accuracy of predictions for these two cutoff values."

    "The figure above shows the relationship between fixed threshold cutoff value and prediction accuracy (dashed line) and the share of observations that would be matched and not sent to clerical coding (solid line). The figure depicts probability threshold ranges between 0.01 and 0.20. Accuracy rates increase steadily with prediction probability, going from about 0.85 at 0.01 probability cutoff and exceeding 95 percent accuracy at a cutoff threshold of 0.02. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the share of cases that would receive an autocode assignment falls much faster with increases in the threshold than is gained in prediction accuracy. A decision would have to be made in terms of the relative tradeoff between the cost savings from sending fewer cases to clerical coding versus prediction accuracy. One guide is that the production autocoder does not send cases to clerical coding if the predicted probability is 0.88. The figure above indicates that specifying a maximum probability threshold of 0.025 would be associated with a 90 percent accuracy rate and would save about 70 percent (of the 72 percent that were not matched via the index autocoder) of cases from going to clerical coding. Currently, the production autocoder sends between 50 and 60 percent of cases to clerical coding. An alternative would be to target the same number of cases going to clerical coding, which would be associated with a probability threshold between 0.05 and 0.075. While accuracy rates are in excess of 90 percent in this cutoff range, the gain in accuracy may not meet the cost savings in clerical coding by choosing a lower threshold.\n",

    "The figure above shows the relationship between overall prediction accuracy and sample loss when choosing occupation codes based on a maximum probability estimate within different deviations from the mean. The tails of the probability distribution are long, with records for about 65 percent of cases being selected based on a probability estimate 20 standard deviations from the mean probability estimate. If we follow convention in the previous section and choose a 90 percent accuracy rate, that is associated with a maximum probability estimate being 15 standard deviations from the mean and assignment for between 75 and 80 percent of all cases predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to choosing a fixed cutoff, the flexible cutoff thresholds allow for greater sample retention for a given prediction accuracy; that is, fewer records go to clerical coding for a given probability threshold. For example, to achieve a 95 percent accuracy rate in the predicted sample, we could select cases where the prediction probability is 20 standard deviations from the mean. This creterion would assign codes for 60 percent of cases (net of what was assigned by the index autocoder) and leave close to 40 percent of the remainder to be clerical coded. For the fixed threshold model, achieving 95 percent occupation assignment accuracy requires specifying a probability threshold between 0.12 and 0.125 but at a cost of assigning codes for between 30 and 40 percent of cases (leaving 60 to 70 percent of cases for clerical coding).\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows, we create a selection criterion based on two cases: a fixed threshold of $Pr\\ge0.03$ and a flexible threshold where the predicted probability is 15 or more standard deviations from the mean. I then add these predictions to the full file and summarise the incidence of occupation code assignment and the accuracy rate for this ensemble."

    "## 4. Summary and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "This jupyter notebook presented a complete ML workflow to implement an ensemble autocoder for assigning Census occupation codes to ACS occupation write-in text fields. The ensemble uses a custom exact-matching autocoder to first select a set of high-accuracy (approaching 100 percent) matches before using a trained random forest classifier model to predict occupation codes for the unmatched remainder. Compared to the production autocoder, which saves between 40 and 50 percent of records from going to clerical coding, the ensemble presented here is able to save close to 86 percent of records from going to clerical coding at the same level of model accuracy. The approach implemented here demonstrates that updating the occupation autocoder would generate real cost savings for the Census Bureau.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used natural language processing (NLP) techniques to vectorize and lemmatize text from the write-in fields for use in a ML framework. Lemmatization was chosen as a way to reduce the column dimension of the text fields. In addition, I incorporated a relatively large set of features thought to account for differences in occupational assignment based on results from the urban and labor economics literatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of this work suffer from two major limitations. First, time and available Census computing resource limited my choice of model selection and the size of sample I could use to fit that model. I limited my sample to *n* = 250 for each of the 570 occupation classes (chosen randomly and with replacement), which amounted to a roughly 3 percent sample. The selected random forest model was chosen based on a Grid Search across combinations of three different hyperparameters. This modeling strategy required days of continuous server operation; other methods, such as Gradient Boosting, never converged prior to the project's termination. With more time, I could have attempted other modeling frameworks that might more efficiently handle the full set of records (e.g., Logistic Regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, accuracy estimates are dependent on the quality of the labels and they may be measured with error. The occupation code labels used here were previously assigned either by the existing production autocoder or clerical coder. To the extent that either is measured inaccurately, the accuracy estimates may be biased. Since the ML framework can only learn from the labeled data, this issue is likely to be more pronounced in the exact-match autocoder. Nonetheless, the labels are likely as good as they are going to get and, in the aggregate, are likely \"correct\" on average. \n",
